This guide will help you set up the bidirectional Figma integration for your portfolio, allowing you to sync designs between your code and Figma in real-time.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Figma account: **ghazal.erfani.2140@gmail.com**
- Portfolio running locally on `http://localhost:3001`
- Access to Figma Developer settings

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Figma Personal Access Token

1. **Go to Figma Developer Settings**
   - Visit: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens
   - Sign in with your account: `ghazal.erfani.2140@gmail.com`

2. **Create New Token**

   - Name: `Portfolio Integration`
   - Description: `Bidirectional sync for Ghazal Erfani Portfolio`
   - Click "Create token"

3. **Copy the Token**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)
   - It should look like: `figd_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. **Open your `.env.local` file** (already created in your project)

2. **Add your token**:
   ```env
   FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN=figd_your_actual_token_here
   ```

3. **Get your Figma file key** (if you have an existing file):
   - Open your Figma file
   - Copy the file key from URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/FILE_KEY/FILE_NAME`
   - Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   FIGMA_FILE_KEY=your_file_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Access the Integration

1. **Start your development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the Figma integration page**:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/figma-demo
   - You should see the Figma Integration interface

### Step 4: Push Your Portfolio Design to Figma

1. **Click "Push Design to Figma"**
   - This will create Figma components from your current portfolio
   - If you don't have a file key, it will create a new Figma file for you

2. **What gets created in Figma**:
   - ðŸŽ¯ Main interactive bubble with gradient
   - ðŸ”µ Persona bubbles (Engineer, Educator, Movement Builder)
   - ðŸŽ¨ Color palette with all your design tokens
   - ðŸ“± Inspiration card components
   - ðŸŽ­ Typography styles

### Step 5: Enable Real-time Sync

1. **Click "Start Real-time Sync"**
   - This monitors your Figma file for changes every 5 seconds
   - Changes will be detected and shown in the interface

2. **Make changes in Figma**:
   - Change colors of the bubbles
   - Modify text styles
   - Adjust spacing or sizes
   - The sync will detect these changes

3. **Apply changes to your code**:
   - Review detected changes in the interface
   - Click "Apply Changes" to update your portfolio

## ðŸŽ¨ What You Can Sync

### From Code â†’ Figma:
- âœ… Interactive bubble chart design
- âœ… Color palette (accent1, accent2, accent3, gradients)
- âœ… Typography system (headings, body text)
- âœ… Component layouts (cards, timelines)
- âœ… Spacing and sizing tokens
- âœ… Animation properties

### From Figma â†’ Code:
- âœ… Color changes
- âœ… Typography updates
- âœ… Spacing modifications
- âœ… Component styling
- âœ… Layout adjustments

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Features

### Design Token Extraction
Your portfolio's design tokens are automatically extracted:
- **Colors**: All accent colors, persona colors, gradients
- **Typography**: Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing**: Margins, paddings, component dimensions
- **Animations**: Duration, easing, effects

### Component Mapping
- `BubbleChart` â†’ Figma interactive bubbles
- `InspirationCard` â†’ Figma card components
- `PersonaSection` â†’ Figma persona layouts
- `Header` â†’ Figma navigation components

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid Figma configuration" error**
   - Check that your `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` is correctly set
   - Ensure the token starts with `figd_`
   - Restart your development server after adding the token

2. **"File key is required" error**
   - Add a `FIGMA_FILE_KEY` to your `.env.local`
   - Or let the system create a new file for you

3. **"Failed to push design" error**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify your Figma token has the right permissions
   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages

4. **Sync not detecting changes**
   - Make sure you're editing the correct Figma file
   - Changes need to be saved in Figma
   - Check that the watched nodes exist in your file

## ðŸ“± Mobile Testing

The integration works on mobile devices:
- Responsive design for the integration interface
- Touch-friendly controls
- Mobile-optimized sync status indicators

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Experiment with the sync**:
   - Push your design to Figma
   - Make changes in Figma
   - See them reflected in your portfolio

2. **Customize the integration**:
   - Modify which components get synced
   - Add new design tokens
   - Customize the sync frequency

3. **Build your design system**:
   - Use Figma as your design source of truth
   - Keep your code and designs in perfect sync
   - Collaborate with designers seamlessly
