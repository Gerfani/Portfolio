            I&apos;m a unique blend of software engineer, educator, and movement builder - three personas that combine 
            to create an ideal skillset for supercharging developer ecosystems. My engineering background from Google 
            and Duke gives me deep technical credibility, while my experience as an educator helps me make complex 
            concepts accessible and engaging. As a movement builder, I understand how to cultivate thriving communities 
            and drive adoption. This combination allows me to not just build great developer tools, but to teach 
            their value effectively and build passionate communities around them.
